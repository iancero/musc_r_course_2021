## Practice 1

1. Import the `cancer.sav` dataset, using the `haven::read_spss()` command.
2. With the `cancer.sav` dataset imported, reproduce this figure as precisely as possible.

Hint: don't forget, you can consult Google and `vignette('ggplot2-specs')`

```{r, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
library(tidyverse)

df <- haven::read_spss('data/cancer.sav')

names(df) <- tolower(names(df))

ggplot(df, aes(weighin, age)) +
  geom_point(aes(size = stage), color = 'blue', shape = 1)
```



# Practice 2

1. Make a scatterplot with some of your ABCD data.
2. Make the figure publication ready by...
    - Changing the theme to have a black background
    - Making the whole figure greyscale
    - Renaming the axes and legend
3. Export your final product as a `.png` file.
