Random forest - Rejoyce - grad school cacoon - clinical psych intern

	"Machine learning day - Random forests"
	Latter end of things
	Machine learning, random forest
		Predict start using substance use across two year period


LM/GLM - Brittney Bryant - Assistant proff on K12, working on K23
	
	Linear and generalized linear models
	School discipline
	Baseline data for school suspensions, racial disparities
	Higher rates of suspensions among black and multiracial children
	Want to redo that process for years one and two (not just baseline)
	Are there subjective / objective reasons
	Linear and generalized linear models

SEM - Kathryn - less of a concrete idea, post doc fellow - graduated clinical psych
	
	Longitudinal data sets
	Latent growth curves, latent profile analyses, latent transition analysis
	Predicting transition into substance use initiation (first substance use)	


Multilevel models, datavis -  Pam - epidemiologist, long time stats devotee, newest to the group. Graduate of UR

	Air pollution associated with mental health

	Job is statistics
	Really interested in visualization

LM / Multilevel models - Britney Browning - nuero student -

Chi-squares and t-tests ,Anna Kirkland - post doc at MUSC in 2nd year, graduated from American in neuro
	Data from substudy of ABCD and not available yet
	Re-working ideas

			among kids with substance use, eating disorders

categorical regression predictors, pivoting - Alexis - phd in 2020 (clinical science) - NIAAA T32
	Clinical assistant professor, 100% clinical
	Self regulation and different diagnoses lead to substance use later
	Most work is transdiagnostic
	Multilevel models
	How to work with categorical data in regression context


Make sure to do dummy coding in LM/GLM, but also managing potentially hundreds of demographic categories
	Sex, race, ethnicity in ABCD
